# Lesson 4 Project
For this project, you will expand upon a template using what you learned in this lesson to apply structural elements. You will then create your first web page based upon that template. 

>**TIP:** You may need to nest elements to complete the objectives of the assignment. Learn more about Nested HTML Elements at [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)

## Project Prep
1. Clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   >**TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.
   >**TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

## Part 1: Improve the Template
1. Open the template.html file from your Lesson 3 course folder.
0. Save the file as **template.html** to your Lesson 4 course folder.
0. Delete the paragraph(s) with the information about you.
0. **Add metadata** elements to define the following elements: 
    - Define the character encoding as UTF-8. 
    - Define the author using your first and last names.
    - Add the metadata elements for the key terms and descriptions. However, leave the `content` attribute empty for each element. You will be adding content for Part 2 of the project.
0.  **Create a header element**. Then complete the following:
    - **Move the multi-line HTML comment** with the Course, Section, and Lesson Number information to be after the opening header tag. Update the lesson information to reflect this lesson. 
    - **Move the first level heading** to be after the multi-line comment. 
    - **Move the first paragraph** to be after the first level heading. Change the verbiage to a simple quote that you find inspirational/educational. This will be your slogan for the course to keep you motivated (e.g., "A mind once stretched by a new idea never regains its original dimensions.")
    - **Create a navigation menu** after the slogan.
    - **Create a hyperlink** within the navigation menu using the following:
        - For the display text: Placeholder Link
        - For the target page: use a hashtag (i.e., #) This will make the link clickable, but not navigate away from the current page. 

0. **Create a main element,** Then complete the following.
    - **Move the second level heading** to be after the opening tag. Change the text to read: Content Heading.
    - **Create a paragraph** filled with dummy text.

0. **Create a footer element**. Then complete the following.
    - **Move the contact paragraph** with the phone and email contact information to after the opening tag.
    - **Apply appropriate text-level semantic elements** around the word "Phone:" and "Email:" to create a bold appearance.
    - **Move the copyright paragraph** with the page copyright info:
        - Add a copyright symbol between the text "Copyright" and the year. 
        - Apply the appropriate element so the copyright information displays as small print. 
0. Correct any and all validation errors using either a web validator or an extension within VS Code.
0. Remember to save your work!

## Part 2: Create a Poetry Page
For this part of your assignment, you will need to find a poem. Use your Internet researching skills to find a poem that has multiple stanzas (paragraphs) in order to complete the Project steps below:


1. If necessary, open the template.html file in your Lesson 4 course folder.
0. Save the template in the same Lesson 4 folder as `poetry.html`
0. **Update the metadata** on the page:
    
    - Add a minimum of **5 keywords** that would be appropriate for the page.
    - Add a **brief description**.
        - Add a **comment** after your metadata to explain which SEO best practice(/s) you applied when creating your keywords and description and how the metadata may help your page appear higher within search results.
    - Update the page **title** to follow this format: `FirstName's Poetry Page`.

        > **TIP:** Replace FirstName with your actual first name.

0. **Update the header** element.
    - Change the **first-level heading** to read `Poetry Page`.
    - Modify the **navigation link** to point to the template.html page and change the display text to read: `Template`.

0. **Modify the main content**.
    - Change the **second-level heading** to the title of the poem.
    - Change the **paragraph text** to the author's name.
    - Add another **paragraph** and paste the text of the poem into the paragraph.

        > **TIP:** Use separate **paragraphs** for each *stanza* (the group of lines that form the poem; a verse).

    - Add a final paragraph with the text: `Source - {Title of the web page}`
    
        > **TIP:** Use the actual title of the web page where you found the poem.
    - Make the text **small**.

    - Add a **comment** after the paragraph with the URL to the poem.&nbsp;
    - Identify a part of the poem that you really like and utilize an appropriate text-level semantic tag around the text.
    - Add a comment explaining why that tag is the most appropriate compared to the other available tags.
0. **Add an HTML comment** near the bolded text within the footer explaining which element you used to bold the “Phone” and “Email” text and why you believe that element is the most appropriate compared to other available tags.
0. Correct any and all validation errors using either a web validator or an extension within VS Code.
0. Remember to save your work.
