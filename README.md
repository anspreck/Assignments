# Lesson 4 Project
For this project, you will expand upon a template using what you learned in this lesson to apply structural elements. You will then create your first web page based upon that template. 

>**TIP:** You may need to nest elements to complete the objectives of the assignment. Learn more about Nested HTML Elements at [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)

<br>

## Project Prep
1. Clone the repo to your computer within your course folder.
2. Open the repo within VS Code. You can open this `readme.md` file within VS Code to view the project directions there. 

   >**TIP:** Right click on the file and choose the `Open Preview` option.
3. If there are files and folders present other than this `readme.md` file, take some time to familiarize yourself with the files within the repo so you know where they are located. This will help you when asked to use them within the project directions.
   >**TIP:** Before beginning any work on the project, read through all the steps to understand what you will be doing.

## Part 1: Improve the Template
1. Open the **template.html** file.
0. **Add metadata** elements to define the following elements: 
    - Define the `character encoding` as `UTF-8`. 
    - Define the `author` using your `first` and `last` names.
    - Add `metadata` elements for `key terms` and `descriptions`. Leave the `content` attribute empty for each element. You will be adding content in Part 2 of this project.

0.  **Create a header element**, then complete the following within it:
    - **Update the multi-lined comment** with your **Course Name** and **Section Number**.
    - **Add a first level heading** after the multi-line comment. 
    - **Add a single paragraph** after the first level heading. 
        - Within the paragraph, write a simple quote that you find inspirational/educational to keep you motivated (*e.g., "A mind once stretched by a new idea never regains its original dimensions"*).
        - **Apply an appropriate text-level semantic element** to the quote to change it's appearance to italic.
    - **Create a navigation menu** after the slogan paragraph.
    - **Create a hyperlink** within the navigation menu using the following:
        - For the `display` text: `Placeholder Link`
        - For the `target` page: use a `hashtag (i.e., #)`. This will make the link clickable, but not navigate away from the current page. 

0. **Create a main element,** then complete the following within it:
    - **Add a second level heading** after the opening tag that reads: `Content Heading`
    - **Create a paragraph** filled with dummy text.

0. **Create a footer element**, then complete the following within it:
    - **Add a paragraph element** to display the following copyright info: `Copyright {CurrentYear}`
        > **TIP:** Replace {CurrentYear} with the current year.
        - **Add a copyright symbol** between the text "Copyright" and the year. 
            > If you have trouble remembering how to create a copyright symbol, review [Character Entity References](https://riosalado.coursearc.com/content/cis133da-in-v12/lesson-3-introduction-html/hypertext-markup-language#Character-Entity-References) from Lesson 3.
        - **Apply an appropriate text-level semantic element** so the copyright information displays as small print.
0. Within VS Code, correct any validation errors that may appear in your code using the [Web Development Student Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RioSaladoCollegeMedia.web-development-student-pack) you installed in Lesson 0: Course Introduction.
    - You may ignore any warnings that may appear with your files. However, you are required to correct any and ***all*** validation **errors**.
0. Remember to save your work!

## Part 2: Create a Poetry Page
For this part of your assignment, you will use text-level semantics to demonstrate when to properly use the tags included in HTML5 that adds context to words, sentences, or symbols. 

## Project Prep

1. Use your Internet researching skills to find a poem that has multiple stanzas. A stanza is a group of lines that forms a pattern of meter and rhyme - like a verse in a song.
2. Save the following information in a separate document:
    - The link to the webpage
    - The title of the web page
    - The title of the poem
    - The author's name
    - And the text of the poem


## Create the Poetry Page

1. If necessary, open the template.html file in your Lesson 4 course folder.
0. Save the template in the same Lesson 4 folder as `poetry.html`
0. **Update the metadata** on the page:
    - Update the page **title** to follow this format: `{FirstName}'s Poetry Page`.
        > **TIP:** Replace {FirstName} with your actual first name.
    - **Add a minimum of five (5) keywords** that would be appropriate for the page.
    - **Add a brief description** that appropriately describes the content on the poetry page that you will add below.
    - **Add a comment** after your metadata to explain which SEO best practice(/s) you applied when creating your keywords and description and how the metadata may help your page appear higher within search results.

0. **Update the header** element.
    - **Change the first-level heading** to read `Poetry Page`.
    - **Modify the navigation link** to point to the `template.html` page and change the **display text** to read: `Template`.

0. **Modify the main content**.
    - **Change the second-level heading** to the title of the poem.
    - **Change the paragraph text** to the author's name.
    - **Paste the text of the poem** you found in the Project Prep steps and use separate `paragraphs` for each stanza in the poem.
    - **Add a final paragraph** with the text: `Source - {Title of the web page}`
        > **TIP:** Use the actual title of the web page where you found the poem.
    - **Add a comment** after the final paragraph with the URL to the poem.

0. **Demonstrate text-level semantics** by making the following changes to your poem:
    - **Identify a sentence** (or two) in the poem that you find is important.
    - **Utilize an appropriate text-level semantic tag** around the text to change the significance of the sentence.
    - **Add a comment** next to the line that explains why you found the text important.
    - **Add a comment** near the slogan paragraph within the header and compare the tags used to changed the style. Explain why each tag is the most appropriate tag to use compared to other available semantic tags.

0. Within VS Code, correct any validation errors that may appear in your code using the [Web Development Student Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RioSaladoCollegeMedia.web-development-student-pack) you installed in Lesson 0: Course Introduction.
    - You may ignore any warnings that may appear with your files. However, you are required to correct any and ***all*** validation **errors**.
