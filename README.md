# Lesson 4 Project
For this project, you will expand upon a template using what you learned in this lesson to apply structural elements. You will then create your first web page based upon that template. 

> **TIP: You may need to **nest** elements to complete the objectives of the assignment. Learn more about [Nested HTML Elements at W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp)
